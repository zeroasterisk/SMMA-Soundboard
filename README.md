# St. Matthews Martial Arts - Soundboard

Idea: a mobile app which presents a soundboard for common sayings,
from various instructors.

## Data

- Sounds: name, author, tags, mp3
- Boards: name, style, query {filters for sounds}
- Content: contact, schedule, events, announcements

## Features

- Main board
- Instructor boards, one for each (or segments of one)
- Theme board (organize by tags on sounds)

## Roadmap

- [ ] React + ReactNative + Redux
  This allows us to render the UI on mobile, as native code
- [ ] AutoUpdates - CodePush
  This allows the code to be automatically updated without downloading a new app
- [ ] Dynamic content updates (AJAX/GraphQL/CDN)
- [ ] Build a few sounds (need assets + meta data)
- [ ] Build boards based on sounds (basic proof of concept)
- [ ] Build content (placeholders of content)
- [ ] Build legit content
- [ ] Build admin webapp (side project)
